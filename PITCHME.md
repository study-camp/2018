### [Win customers <br/> with mobile sites](https://academy.exceedlms.com/student/path/2967#)

  * Mobile website = accessible from mobile device
  * Discoverability + familiarity for users
  * Lower costs + higher reach for businesses
  * Website speed = critical for user conversions

<!-- Speaker Notes -->
Note:

_Time: 5 mins_

Three main turnoffs for mobile websites: 
 * slow page loads
 * poor user experience 
 * (cellular) network constraints (e.g., bandwidth)

Why are mobile sites critical to users?
 * easy to discover (no pre-install)
 * intuitive to use (familiar UI/UX)
 * readily available on phones

Why are mobile sites critical to businesses?
 * lower development/maintenance costs
 * high usability * tracking
 * single codebase for cross-platform reach
