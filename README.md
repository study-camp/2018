# 2018 Study Camps

This repo will serve as a placeholder for sharing information and resources related to 2018 Study Camps. I'm also experimenting with using [GitPitch](https://gitpitch.com/) to make it easier to move from having Markdown notes, to making those notes _presentable_ to audiences by default.

## Setup

To create a new resource/talk/topic:

 1. Create a new _branch_ based on the [_template_ branch](https://github.com/study-camp/2018/tree/template) and name it with the topic of interest (e.g., ```gcp-essentials```). 
 2. Commit that new branch to GitHub. 
 3. The relevant template instance will now become available automatically at _https://gitpitch.com/study-camp/2018/<topic name>_ (e.g., for topic gcp-essentials, the slides will then be hosted at ```https://gitpitch.com/study-camp/2018/gcp-essentials```)
 4. Edit **PITCHME.yaml** to change presentation config (e.g., theme) or edit **PITCHME.md** to change presentation content. Learn more [about slideshow settings here](https://github.com/gitpitch/gitpitch/wiki/Slideshow-Settings). When GitHub repo changes are committed, related GitPitch is automatically updated.
